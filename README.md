# FUD-Tor-reverse-shell-PoC

Here is a Proof of Concept (POC) for my red team implant project, designed to be deployed using a Rubber Ducky or any other quick and opportunistic deployment method.

This is a Portable Executable (PE) for Windows that establishes a reverse shell via the Tor network while remaining persistent until the target PC shuts down. This means that the payload remains functional even in the event of a loss of connection to the host.

All dependencies are packed within the executable, including legitimate and properly signed dependencies and programs. Thus, this reverse shell does not require any third-party installation (even for Tor).

I chose to use the Tor network for the following reasons :

- Anonymity : Ensuring control over the entry node while maintaining anonymity.
- Evasion : Better evasion of firewalls by leveraging TCP traffic on port 443.
- Simplicity : Avoiding port forwarding or additional configurations. It is truly a functional plug-and-play solution.


However, I was unable to test it on an EDR, and I have concerns about its ability to bypass them due to its high entropy (7.3), which could attract attention ...
